# portfolio
On GitHub, a "portfolio" is typically referred to as a repository that is specifically designed to showcase your projects and skills, usually hosted using the "GitHub Pages" feature, where you would name the repository something like "portfolio" or "[your-username].github.io" to access it as a website.
